## Description and history

Nitrux is a Linux desktop distribution directly based on Debian. It uses the Calamares installer and includes NX Desktop and NX Firewall on top of the KDE Plasma 5 desktop environment and KDE Applications. Nitrux emphasizes the use of AppImages to manage end-user software. Nitrux also does not use systemD as its init system; instead, it uses OpenRC.

Nitrux includes a suite of convergent applications called Maui Apps. We use MauiKit, our convergent, cross-platform UI framework, to create these applications. Both MauiKit and the Maui Apps are entirely free and open-source software.

In addition to this, we include a curated selection of free and open-source software by default; we don’t add proprietary software. And for those looking for a 100% free (as in freedom) operating system, the optional Linux Libre kernel is available to install.

Nitrux is always up-to-date, thanks to using the latest Debian base and to the effort of the KDE Neon developers, who provide the latest stable releases of Plasma. Nitrux also provides its users of the latest MESA drivers from Git, and kernels optimized for intensive tasks such as gaming with XanMod and Liquorix.

> Note: On Distrowatch it is incorrectly listed as Ubuntu LTS derivative.
