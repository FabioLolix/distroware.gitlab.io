# Void Linux

## Screenshot


## Description and history

Independent Linux distribution based on the unique X Binary Package System (XBPS).

Beginning in 2008, Juan Romero Pardines ("xtraeme"), wrote XBPS and the Void Linux ports system, xbps-src. In 2018, after xtraeme had been unreachable for some time, a group of Void Linux contributors moved to the distro to the current domain name.

## License and type

Licensing varies per-package:

* All packages in the main repository are free and open  source software.
* A "non-free" repository is provided for non-FOSS software that permits redistribution, such as device drivers, IDEs, browsers, a bunch of Electron apps, and Steam.
* Some "restricted" packages, which cannot be redistributed, can be built from source using the Void Linux ports system. These packages are not available in any repository.

The non-free repository is not enabled by default. Licensing information is stored in the metadata of each package.

## Packaging, sources, repositories and building
