There isn't a proper sponsoring program but you're welcome to get in touch

Hardware donations are welcome too, some nice to have:

* Raspberry Pi 5
* ARM and RISC-V boards, Linux friendly handhelds, etc
* Low capacity SSDs; even 30 or 60 GB ones are still fine for installing distros
* Linux friendly USB TV Tuner DVB-T2
