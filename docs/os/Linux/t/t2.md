## Description and history

> T2 System Development Environment (T2SDE) is a flexible, source-based, Distribution Build Kit / Open Source System Development Environment (some say Meta Distribution). Its aim is to support as many CPU architectures as possible as well as multiple kernels, with cross-compiling being the core feature.

Developed and actively maintained by René REBE and contributors.

## Packaging, sources, repositories and building

* Sources: `.desc` receipts
* Packaging: compressed tarballs (currently with zstd).
* Repositories: No binary repositories at the moment, only point release iso images.

Being a source-based distribution, all build scripts are available in the subversion source repo.

Here is a [quick start guide](https://t2sde.org/zine/8/).
And the general [documentation](https://t2sde.org/handbook/html/t2-book.html) (old but still mostly relevant).
