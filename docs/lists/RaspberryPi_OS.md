OpenBSD/arm64 bundles various platforms sharing the 64-bit ARM architecture
Due to the fact that there are many System on a Chips (SoC) around
OpenBSD/arm64 differentiates between various SoCs and may have a different level of support between them
The current target platforms are Firefly-RK3399, Pine64, Raspberry Pi 3 and Opteron A1100.
