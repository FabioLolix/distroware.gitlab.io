## Description and history

AlmaLinux OS is an enterprise linux distribution that is fully compatible with [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](../r/red-hat.md)-equivalent operating system, guided and built by its community. AlmaLinux was the first CentOS Linux replacement to launch after the announcement that Red Hat would no longer be providing the downstream version of it OS for free.

It is a standalone, completely free OS, and is funded and supported by over 30 corporate sponsors, including Platinum Sponsor Members CloudLinux and Cybertrust Japan. Ongoing development efforts are governed by the members of the community and are not controlled by any sponsor.

The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit created to own and manage everything to do with AlmaLinux, and for the benefit of the AlmaLinux OS community.
